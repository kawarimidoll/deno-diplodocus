SSG for Deno Deploy

Now developing with fun!

[![deploy](https://deno.com/deno-deploy-button.svg)](https://diplodocus.deno.dev/)

## Motivation

Most of Deno products still use the platforms such as GitHub Pages, Vercel or
Netlify for its documentation. But now Deno Deploy has serving static assets
feature, and I think Deno Deploy is the most suitable select for Deno Products!

Diplodocus is the simple static serving system only for Deno Deploy with
no-build. It is useful to create the documents or blog sites.
